    <!--World Imagery provides one meter or better satellite and aerial imagery in many parts of the world and lower resolution satellite imagery worldwide.
    The map includes 15m TerraColor imagery at small and mid-scales (591M down to 72k) and 2.5m SPOT Imagery (288k to 72k) for the world,
    and USGS 15m Landsat imagery for Antarctica.
    The map features 0.3m resolution imagery in the continental United States and 0.6m resolution imagery in parts of Western Europe from Digital Globe.
     Recent 1m USDA NAIP imagery is available in select states of the US. In other parts of the world, 1 meter resolution imagery is available from GeoEye IKONOS, AeroGRID, and IGN Spain.
     Additionally, imagery at different resolutions has been contributed by the GIS User Community. For more information on this map, including the terms of use,

    <!-- This worldwide street map presents highway-level data for the world. Street-level data includes the United States;
    much of Canada; Mexico; Europe; Japan; Australia and New Zealand; India; South America and Central America; Africa; and most of the Middle East.
    This comprehensive street map includes highways, major roads, minor roads, one-way arrow indicators, railways, water features, administrative boundaries, cities, parks, and landmarks, overlaid on shaded relief imagery for added context.
    The map also includes building footprints for selected areas. Coverage is provided down to ~1:4k with ~1:1k and ~1:2k data available in select urban areas.
    The street map was developed by Esri using Esri basemap data, DeLorme basemap layers, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) elevation data,
    Intact Forest Landscape (IFL) data for the world; HERE data for Europe, Australia and New Zealand, North America, South America and Central America, Africa, and most of the Middle East;
    OpenStreetMap contributors for select countries in Africa and Pacific Islands; MapmyIndia data in India; NGCC data for China; and select data from the GIS user community.

    <!--This map portrays surface elevation as shaded relief.
    This map is used as a basemap layer to add shaded relief to other GIS maps, such as the ArcGIS Online World Street Map.
     It is especially useful in maps that do not contain orthoimagery.
     The map resolution (cell size) is as follows: 30 Meters for the U.S. 90 Meters for all land areas between 60° north and 56° south latitude.
      1 KM resolution above 60° north and 56° south.
      The shaded relief imagery was developed by Esri using GTOPO30, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and National Elevation Data (NED) data from the USGS.
